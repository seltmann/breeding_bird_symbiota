### Objective: Take data from the [Santa Barbara Breeding Bird Survey](https://santabarbaraaudubon.org/santa-barbara-county-breeding-bird-study/) format in Darwin Core and upload to UCSB Natural History Collection Network Portal. Export portal to GBIF/. record_number is the unique identifier for this record.

```{r}
#read in data and create view of file. Print column names. Several column names are missing.
birds <- read_csv(here("SB_BBS_OneDrive_SHARED_BACKUP.csv"))
View(birds)
colnames(birds)
```

```{r}
#remove columns that do not have names and clean names by removing all white spaces
birds <- birds %>%
  clean_names()

birds <- select(birds, c(1:19))
colnames(birds)
```

```{r}
#Create new date_transform and selected_observer columns. Can add new selected observers to this list to include in the filtering.
birds <- birds %>%
  mutate(occurrenceID = record_number) %>%
  mutate(basisOFRecord = "HumanObservation") %>%
  mutate(country = "United States of America") %>%
  mutate(stateProvince = "California") %>%
  mutate(county = "Santa Barbara") %>%
  mutate(decimalLongitude = longitude) %>%
  mutate(decimalLatitude = latitude) %>%
  mutate(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters = gps_certainty_meters) %>%
  mutate(maximumElevationInMeters = elev_meters) %>%
  mutate(recordedBy = observer) %>%
  mutate(occurrenceRemarks = paste(breeding_evidence,code,common_name, comments,observation,nest_species_structure,nest_hgt_meters,sources, sep = "; "))

colnames(birds)
View(birds)

```

```{r}
#TODO: remove time from dates and format dates so Year-Month-Day. Check to see if new format is correct.
#3-Jan-1998 should be 1998-01-03
birds <- birds %>%
  mutate(eventDate = dmy(birds$date))
date_check <- select(birds, c(9,31))
View(date_check)
```

```{r}
#TODO: link to image

```

```{r}
#remove extra columns
birds = select(birds, c(20:24,7,25:28,19,29:31))
```

```{r}
#write file for upload to Symbiota
write_tsv(birds,"breeding_bird_DwC.tsv")
